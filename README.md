KMeans on C++ using Eigen
--------------------------------------
This is my literally first take on C++. I was interested if native (and naive) KMeans implementation will be much faster than JVM-based implementation (hint: not so much).

Also took the chance to use Eigen library for vectorization. Looks neat!

Used Eigen 3.3.9 (pre-4.0) directly from master for slicing functionality.
